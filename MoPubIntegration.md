AvocarrotMoPubNativeCustomEvent
```

**Custom Event Class Data**

```javascript
{"adUnit":"<AvocarrotAdUnit>"}
```

Get your adUnit from the [Avocarrot dashboard](https://ui.ampiri.com/).

## 4. Ready to go

Congratulations! You have now successfully integrated **Avocarrot** ad network and you should receive your first ad from there.

## Troubleshooting

- Please have in mind, that any time you make a change to the MoPub dashboard, try to fetch an ad a couple of times and then wait a few minutes for MoPub's cache to clear.
- You can also try cloning the example project below to make sure everything is running fine.
- If at any point you need any technical help, please get in touch with [Avocarrot Support](https://docs.ampiri.com/)

## Clone the Example Project
* `git clone https://github.com/avocarrot/avocarrot-ios-adapters.git`
